# Password Reset Duplicate Prevention Feature

## Overview
This feature prevents users from submitting multiple password reset requests within a 24-hour period and provides clear feedback about the approval process.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Duplicate Request Prevention
- **24-hour cooldown**: Users cannot submit multiple password reset requests within 24 hours
- **Automatic expiration**: Requests older than 24 hours are automatically marked as expired when a new request is submitted
- **Clear messaging**: Users receive informative messages about their existing pending requests

### 2. User-Friendly Messages
- **Warning messages**: When a user tries to submit a duplicate request, they see:
  - The exact date and time of their existing request
  - Instructions to wait for administrator approval
  - Contact information for urgent assistance
- **Form validation**: JavaScript prevents form submission if a pending request exists
- **Real-time status checking**: Users can check their request status by entering their username

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Information alerts**: The password reset form includes information about the approval process
- **Status display**: Shows pending request details when a username is entered
- **Preventive measures**: Multiple layers of protection against duplicate submissions

## Technical Implementation

### Model Enhancements
- Added `has_pending_request()` method to `PasswordResetRequest` model
- Added `get_pending_request(user)` class method for easy querying
- Automatic expiration of old requests when new ones are submitted

### View Logic
- Checks for existing pending requests before creating new ones
- Calculates time differences to determine if requests are within the 24-hour window
- Provides detailed feedback messages with timestamps
- Handles request expiration automatically

### Template Improvements
- Added informational alerts about the approval process
- Dynamic status display for pending requests
- JavaScript validation to prevent form submission
- Real-time status checking on username input

## User Flow

1. **User visits password reset page**
   - Sees information about the approval process
   - Understands that requests require administrator approval

2. **User enters username**
   - System checks for existing pending requests
   - If found, displays warning with request details
   - Prevents form submission if pending request exists

3. **User submits request**
   - System validates no duplicate requests exist
   - Creates new request and notifies administrators
   - Shows success message with next steps

4. **Duplicate attempt**
   - System detects existing pending request
   - Shows detailed warning message with timestamp
   - Redirects to login page with explanation

## Benefits

- **Reduces spam**: Prevents users from flooding the system with requests
- **Improves user experience**: Clear feedback about request status
- **Administrator efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary duplicate notifications
- **System stability**: Prevents database clutter with duplicate requests
- **User education**: Helps users understand the approval process

## Testing

Use the management command to test the functionality:
```bash
python manage.py test_password_reset_duplicate
```

This command tests:
- Duplicate request detection
- Request expiration logic
- Model helper methods
- Time-based validation

## Configuration

The 24-hour cooldown period can be adjusted by modifying the time calculation in the `password_reset_request` view:

```python
if hours_since_request < 24:  # Change this value as needed
```

## Future Enhancements

- Email notifications to users when their request is approved/rejected
- Dashboard for users to view their request history
- Configurable cooldown periods per user role
- Automatic cleanup of expired requests
